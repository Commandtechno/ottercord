    "description": "Once we receive the properties of a UDP voice server from our [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload, we can proceed to the final step of voice connections, which entails establishing and handshaking a UDP connection for voice data. First, we open a UDP connection to the IP and port provided in the Ready payload. If required, we can now perform an [IP Discovery](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery) using this connection. Once we've fully discovered our external IP and UDP port, we can then tell the voice WebSocket what it is, and start receiving/sending data. We do this using [Opcode 1 Select Protocol](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice):"

To retrieve your external IP and port, send the following UDP packet to your voice port (all numeric are big endian):"
