### Membership Screening Object

In guilds with [Membership Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins, [Guild Member Add](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-add) will be emitted but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [member object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-member-object). When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.

Giving the member a role will bypass Membership Screening as well as the guild's verification level, giving the member immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of giving a role when the member joins, it is recommended to not give the role until the user is no longer `pending`.

> warn
> We are making significant changes to the Membership Screening API specifically related to getting and editing the Membership Screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed those documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.

## Create Guild % POST /guilds

Create a new guild. Returns a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) object on success. Fires a [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) Gateway event.

> warn
> This endpoint can be used only by bots in less than 10 guilds.

> warn
> When using the `roles` parameter, the first member of the array is used to change properties of the guild's `@everyone` role. If you are trying to bootstrap a guild with additional roles, keep this in mind.

> info
> When using the `roles` parameter, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.

> warn
> When using the `channels` parameter, the `position` field is ignored, and none of the default channels are created.

> info
> When using the `channels` parameter, the `id` field within each channel object may be set to an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to create `GUILD_CATEGORY` channels by setting the `parent_id` field on any children to the category's `id` field. Category channels must be listed before any children.

> warn
> This field `region` is deprecated and will be removed in v9 and is replaced by [rtc_region](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-structure).

###### Example Partial Channel Object

> warn
> For guilds with Membership Screening enabled, assigning a role using the `roles` parameter will add the user to the guild as a full member (`pending` is false in the [member object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-member-object)). A member with a role will bypass membership screening and the guild's verification level, and get immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of assigning a role when the member joins, it is recommended to grant roles only after the user completes screening.

## Modify Guild Member % PATCH /guilds/{guild.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object}/members/{user.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object}

Fires a [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-update) Gateway event. If the `channel_id` is set to null, this will force the target user to be disconnected from voice.

###### JSON Params

| Field                       | Type               | Description                                    |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- current user must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission to unsuppress yourself. You can always suppress yourself.
- You must have the `REQUEST_TO_SPEAK` permission to request to speak. You can always clear your own request to speak.
- You are able to set `request_to_speak_timestamp` to any present or future time.

## Modify User Voice State % PATCH /guilds/{guild.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object}/voice-states/{user.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object}

Updates another user's voice state.

###### JSON Params

| Field      | Type      | Description                                    |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| channel_id | snowflake | the id of the channel the user is currently in |
| suppress?  | boolean   | toggles the user's suppress state              |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- User must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission. (Since suppression is the only thing that is available currently.)
- When unsuppressed, non-bot users will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` set to the current time. Bot users will not.
- When suppressed, the user will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` removed.
