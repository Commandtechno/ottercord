# Rate Limits

Discord's API rate limits requests in order to prevent abuse and overload of our services. Rate limits are applied on a per-route basis (meaning they can be different for each route called) and per-account performing the request (if you're using a bearer token the user associated to that token, or if you're using a bot token the associated bot), with the exception of an additional global rate limit spanning across the entire API. Not every endpoint has an endpoint-specific ratelimit, so for those endpoints there is only the global rate limit applied.

By "per-route," we mean that unique rate limits exist for the path you are accessing on our API, sometimes including the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and including major parameters. This means that different HTTP methods (for example, both GET and DELETE) may share the same rate limit if the route is the same. Additionally, rate limits take into account major parameters in the URL. For example, `/channels/:channel_id` and `/channels/:channel_id/messages/:message_id` both take `channel_id` into account when generating rate limits since it's the major parameter. Currently, the only major parameters are `channel_id`, `guild_id`, and `webhook_id + webhook_token`.

"Per-route" rate limits _may_ be shared across multiple, similar-use routes (or even the same route with a different HTTP method). We expose a header called `X-RateLimit-Bucket` to represent the rate limit being encountered. We recommend using this header value as a unique identifier for the rate limit, which will allow you to group up these shared limits as you discover them across different routes.

Because we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be different per application, _rate limits should not be hard coded into your bot/application_. In order to properly support our dynamic rate limits, your bot/application should parse for our rate limits in response headers and locally prevent exceeding the limits as they change.

> warn
> [Routes for controlling emojis](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/list-guild-emojis) do not follow the normal rate limit conventions. These routes are specifically limited on a per-guild basis to prevent abuse. This means that the quota returned by our APIs may be inaccurate, and you may encounter 429s.

## Header Format

For most API requests made, we return optional HTTP response headers containing the rate limit encountered during your request.

###### Rate Limit Header Examples

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023
X-RateLimit-Bucket: abcd1234
```

- **X-RateLimit-Global** - Returned only on a HTTP 429 response if the rate limit headers returned are of the global rate limit (not per-route)
- **X-RateLimit-Limit** - The number of requests that can be made
- **X-RateLimit-Remaining** - The number of remaining requests that can be made
- **X-RateLimit-Reset** - Epoch time (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970) at which the rate limit resets
- **X-RateLimit-Reset-After** - Total time (in seconds) of when the current rate limit bucket will reset. Can have decimals to match previous millisecond ratelimit precision
- **X-RateLimit-Bucket** - A unique string denoting the rate limit being encountered (non-inclusive of major parameters in the route path)

## Exceeding A Rate Limit

In the case that a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a HTTP 429 response code with a JSON body.

###### Rate Limit Response Structure

| Field       | Type             | Description                                                      |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| message     | string           | A message saying you are being rate limited.                     |
| retry_after | float | The number of seconds to wait before submitting another request. |
| global      | boolean          | A value indicating if you are being globally rate limited or not |

Note that the normal rate-limiting headers will be sent in this response. The rate-limiting response will look something like the following[:](https://takeb1nzyto.space/)

###### Example Rate Limit Response

```
< HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS
< Content-Type: application/json
< Retry-After: 65
< X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
< X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
< X-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023.123
< X-RateLimit-Reset-After: 64.57
< X-RateLimit-Bucket: abcd1234
{
  "message": "You are being rate limited.",
  "retry_after": 64.57,
  "global": false
}
```

###### Example Global Rate Limit Response

```
< HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS
< Content-Type: application/json
< Retry-After: 65
< X-RateLimit-Global: true
{
  "message": "You are being rate limited.",
  "retry_after": 64.57,
  "global": true
}
```

## Global Rate Limit

All bots can make up to 50 requests per second to our API. This is independent of any individual rate limit on a route. If your bot gets big enough, based on its functionality, it may be impossible to stay below 50 requests per second during normal operations.

Global rate limit issues generally show up as repeatedly getting banned from the Discord API when your bot starts (see below). If your bot gets temporarily CloudFlare banned from the Discord API every once in a while, it is most likely **not** a global rate limit issue. You probably had a spike of errors that was not properly handled and hit our error threshold.

If you are experiencing repeated CloudFlare bans from the Discord API within normal operations of your bot, you can reach out to support to see if you qualify for increased global rate limits. You can contact Discord support using [https://dis.gd/contact](https://dis.gd/contact).

## Invalid Request Limit aka CloudFlare bans

IP addresses that make too many invalid HTTP requests are automatically and temporarily restricted from accessing the Discord API. Currently, this limit is **10,000 per 10 minutes**. An invalid request is one that results in **401**, **403**, or **429** statuses.	

All applications should make reasonable attempts to avoid making invalid requests. For example:	

- **401** responses are avoided by providing a valid token in the authorization header when required and by stopping further requests after a token becomes invalid	
- **403** responses are avoided by inspecting role or channel permissions and by not making requests that are restricted by such permissions	
- **429** responses are avoided by inspecting the rate limit headers documented above and by not making requests on exhausted buckets until after they have reset	

Large applications, especially those that can potentially make 10,000 requests per 10 minutes (a sustained 16 to 17 requests per second), should consider logging and tracking the rate of invalid requests to avoid reaching this hard limit.

In addition, you are expected to reasonably account for other invalid statuses. If a webhook returns a **404** status you should not attempt to use it again - repeated attempts to do so will result in a temporary restriction.
